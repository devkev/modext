This is a very, very early version of modext.  It has its heritage in "module
extensions", and almost everything except for the code itself is out of date,
still referring to module extensions instead of modext.

--------------------

For information on these "module extensions", refer to the comments at the top
of the main extensions.tcl file, as well as those in the individual extension
tcl files.

Another good place to look is in the main template modulefile in
/opt/Modules/template
